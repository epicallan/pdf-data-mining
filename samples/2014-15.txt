(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
The process of developing the structural designs involved wide consulations including International Atomic
Energy Agency, National Energy Committee, Mulago Hospital, Ministry of Energy, and other other stakeholders
which resulted into delays in getting the final designs approved to pave way for the construction. However, the
final designs almost ready as are pending final discussions by the stakeholders. The observed expenditure above
budgeted in capital budget was mainly due to transfer of funds from taxes to capital to buy vehicles and
motorcycles to improve transport at the Institute and in field during awareness on cancer. This was not originally
catered for in the budget for the Financial year.
